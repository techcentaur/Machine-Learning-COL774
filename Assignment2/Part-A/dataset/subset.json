The place ain't bad. Everyone says that the Eastside is the bad part of town, but I had no problems. \n\nI wear Issey Miyake, and it's kind of hard to find the exact cologne I wear. I first went to Macy's but waited a couple of minutes and didn't get any service. After noticing that the workers were just slacking off and ignoring me, I decided that Macy's didn't deserve my business and they could f*ck off.\n\nWhile I was leaving the mall, I saw \"Luxury Perfumes\" and noticed that they had just about every  type of Issey Miyake cologne. The girl working there was real friendly and went out of her way to find the exact cologne I was looking for. She literally sprayed me head to toe with over 10 different variations of Issey Miyake. Eventually, we found the one I was looking for and it only cost $63.00. Stuff from Japan is usually far more expensive than that. \n\nI'm gonna give this place 5-stars all on account of the fact that the girl working here works so hard to make sure every customer leaves satisfied.

They will never see another family member of mine.\n\nThe second visit she had was for a motorcycle accident she was the passenger on the motorcycle.

Where do I start? \n\nMy son injured his wrist Sunday evening, and we rushed him to urgent care. This unfortunately was the closest urgent care facility that had radiology available, so we went in. \n\nUpon arrival, check in was a breeze & Brittany at the front desk was great. We were very quickly taken back for triage and placed in exam room. (We were the only ones there).\n\nWe get in the back and the MA or assistant asked my 10 year old how much he weighed. I was puzzled. Was she not going to weigh him herself if he answered? He didn't remember so she weighed him. We go back to exam room 1 and she gets minimal history. Like barely anything. She leaves and a medical provider comes in. Now, I didn't really get her name or remember it because the meet and greet was so short. But looking at the medical records it was a NP. She asked the same minimal questions and asked if he could move it. I tried explaining to her that he fractured his other wrist the same way when he was 6. And that he is not a complainer when it comes to pain. But he is complaining. She said they would do a X-ray to rule out break. \n\nSame MA comes back and says, \"we are going to do a X-ray, if one of you wants to come you can or just wait here.\" Uh, no. He's 10 and I will come thanks. She takes us to the X-ray room, and gets my son set up and tells me to just stand by the wall. She never asks me if I'm pregnant, nor does she make me wear a lead apron for precaution. I didn't even see one in the room. Weird. \n\nAfter the X-ray she walks us back to exam room where we wait for the NP to come back to tell us what she sees on the X-ray. She comes in about 5 min later, and says it doesn't look fractured. But that hopefully a radiologist will read the report by this evening and gets back to her shortly. And that she will fit my son with a splint and give directions on how to take care of it. MA comes in right after with splint and printed off directions. I ask her if I can get a copy of X-ray image on a disc. She says, \"we don't print them if it's not broken.\" Strange. I confirm if I will be getting a call back if it's broken or not. She said, \"we will call you if it is. If you don't hear from us nothing has changed.\" She went on to explaining the typical care for a sprain. If pain and discomfort persist 7-10 days to go see pediatrician or come back. And that a CT scan may have to be done because there could be ligament and other tissue damage that doesn't show up on a X-ray. I again mentioned that I was surprised it wasn't broken since this happened to him last time and it was indeed a fracture. She responded with, \"she (the NP) has seen many fractures and I have as well and his (my son) wrist doesn't look broken.\" She also mentioned that they will my insurance for the splint and gave me paperwork for that. \n\nWe left and went home to ice and do everything they said. I didn't feel comfortable with the outcome, and I just had a feeling something wasn't right. Well good thing I pressed and followed up with my sons pediatrician. Who ordered a repeat X-ray and sure enough, he has a buckle fracture. Both X-rays look almost exact and not sure how the NP and radiologist missed it. My son complained and I tried to explain his history and how the injury happened. I truly felt this place didn't listen to its patient. Now a week later we are getting him into a cast, no thanks to this urgent care. \n\n1 Star goes to Brittany and the wait time. \n\nSide note: I came back a few days later to get my records along with the disc that they \"don't print when it's not broken\". I questioned Brittany why I couldn't get the images on a disc when I was there. She looked at me perplexed. I explained what the MA told me. And she said she had no problems printing discs for patients. Then followed up with \"I know we were out of them...\" ohhhhhh okay so that was the reason. Ugh.", "date": "2018-03-09 21:20:48"}

The prime rib here is 10 x's better than the one at Ellis Island ($14.99). \n\nMy gfs and I were starving after our drive back to Vegas from CA and wanted to try Primarily Prime Rib. A friend and I wanted to try the cowboy cut ( 26 oz. bone in for $29.95) but found out that there is a $10 extra plate charge so we all decided to go with the southpoint cut ($18.95). It came with your choice of prime or spinach salad OR their soup of the day AND a bake potato OR mashed potatoes OR vegetables.\n\nYou start off with a sour dough bread and some butter. I enjoyed the sour dough because it wasn't super sour and it was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\nWe ordered 3 southpoint cuts, 2 cooked medium and 1 cooked medium rare. I got the mashed potatoes and the spinach salad with dressing on the side. I would recommended getting dressing on the side because they did drench my friends' prime salad in thousand island dressing. I did not like the dressing that came with the spinach salad so I used balsamic vinegar but I'm sure you can swap the vinegarette out for something else. I was surprised to find out that the mashed potatoes weren't made from a box. There were actual chunks of potatoes! However, the baked potato looked a lot better and its made table side so I would recommend the baked potato. They added sour cream, butter and chives. If you want any of those on the side, make sure to let them know. All the prime rib entrees came out perfectly cooked. They were soft and not too fatty. Both of my friends enjoyed their meal. \n\nService was really good. Lighting was perfect, not too bright nor too dim. The music wasn't playing super loudly either. Booths were comfortable. Its a good spot to bring a date or to celebrate something. While I have had better prime rib, for the price, service and quality, it was a good deal!

We called ahead to make reservations and while the hostess was extremely polite, she asked if we had a \"Travel Zoo\" coupon. Well, I couldn't understand what she had said because she talked so fast but that was fine...I didn't have a coupon. So, we get to the restaurant and we are sat outside immediately. We looked over the menu awaiting our waitress and were impressed with the variety of options, especially the GF options. We wanted to look at the drink menu but weren't given any so we just had to await the waitress. Well, about 10 minutes later, the waitress, who had been at all of the other tables, came over asking if we had a \"Travel Zoo\" coupon. Again, she said it so fast, I had no idea why they were so interested if we had a coupon; she did explain that the coupon apparently expired that night so they wanted to see if I had one. Ok, she asked if we wanted a drink because it was before 7:00 and happy hour was still on. Since we didn't have a drink menu, she got us one. \n\nI ordered the Sangria (hh price $5 she said); my husband ordered a Apple Cider drink ($2 off normal price she said). Drinks came out and while very good, my husband's glass was covered in dry food - obviously not clean so he asked for another drink. It came out about 5 minutes later and the waitress made it clear that the dirty glass wasn't her fault...the bartender's fault. This drink was watered down so it seemed reasonable to assume that they might have simply poured his drink into a clean glass. At that point, we weren't feeling too great about our restaurant pick but we pushed on. \n\nFood comes out and it looks delicious. The food was very good and I enjoyed the meal as did my husband; however, his meal was dripping grease (burger) and was difficult to put down once he started eating it. He certainly had to wash his hands after finishing because he was drenched in grease. Unfortunately, he felt quite ill after and into the evening. I don't think there was anything necessarily wrong with the meal, but the amount of grease was simply overwhelming. \n\nWe got our bill and our hh drinks that were supposed to be on discount, weren't; in fact, my Sangria was more expensive than the menu quoted. We watched what appeared to be a manager walking around asking customers about their meals so we anticipated him asking us as well but that never happened. I wonder if he could tell we didn't like it and didn't feel like hearing about it. I wonder if he'll hear about it now that I've taken 10 minutes to type out my experience. We didn't mention the incorrect prices because we just wanted to leave. \n\nSo, I'm left with...the food was decent; drinks not so much, service fine but nothing spectacular...will absolutely not go back and will make sure that others know what to expect if they decide to go.", "date": "2012-03-25 00:11:21"}

The front patio was a big draw and had a nice atmosphere on a summer's night, so they got a lot of sit down business.\n\nAround the same time the quality of the food started to slide but the prices remained high for the area and the portions small. I began to feel ill after eating there. I only eat vegan but wonder if ghee made it into my food, even though I always specified. \n\nA quick glance at their DineSafe history shows two yellow cards in 2013 where pest control, failure to wash hands, failure to wear hair nets among other things cited. Not exactly reassuring.\n\nOn top of that, they have had this broken down old truck sitting in the parking lot for at least 6 years and it has never moved, tires are flat. It's an eyesore and takes up parking spaces, so why keep it there? Maybe it's a load-bearing truck that keeps the sign from falling down?\n\nThey also added some shipping containers by the back side door off the kitchen where you can see people doing food prep sometimes when the door is open. Yup, food is being prepped inside of shipping containers.\n\nThen they screened in the patio, which made it lose all that nice summery appeal and instead felt like you were eating your grandparent's musty screened in porch.\n\nI now go to South Indian Dosa Mahal for my Indian fix. Sure, it's not the same type of cuisine and the place has no atmosphere to speak of, but the food is prepared fresh when you order off menu, it's completely veg and the price is right.\n\nI recommend giving Banjara's filtered reviews a read through as well for a full picture.\n\n*For locals interested in area history, if you walk around the back of Banjara you can still see the \"Coffee Tip\" sign from when it was a sketchy Coffee Time rip off circa 2000.\n\nUpdate: The orange Banjara truck appears to have been repainted by graffiti \"artists\" and is now by the back kitchen door and the shipping containers are now in the parking lot.", "date": "2014-10-18 19:24:58"}

If you aren't too sure what you would like or want to try something new, ask one of the servers or bartenders. They have tried most and can recommend something to your liking.

I don't know why the restaurant offers groupons if they are so obviously unhappy when people with vouchers show up. \n\nWe had been walking behind a couple smoking a joint as we made our way to the resto from the metro. First, we waited 5 minutes before being seated in quite an empty restaurant. Then, it took about 20 minutes for the waiter to bring us water and answer our questions. It was very frustrating sitting there, watching him walk by us and tending to people that had shown up approx. 10 minutes after us before serving us. The waiter really tried pushing drinks on us (several times, and we said no thanks more than once), only for him to say, \"so, just the pot, then?\". It took me a few minutes to understand what he had meant by this comment. By this point, I was extremely anxious and uncomfortable. The music was extremely loud electronic/techno music, which did not create a calming or comfortable ambiance. This, combined with the neglect and sense of the waiter being a salesman as he continuously tried to push us to buy drinks made the experience quite negative. \n\nThe food was alright. Overpriced for what we paid (which was about half off from the regular prices). The food was also almost cold by the time it got to us. It took us 2h10m to get served apps, entrees and dessert. We continuously had to seek out the attention of the waiter, which sometimes meant shouting over the loud music. \n\nWe got the bill and had to pay the taxes and well as tip, and the tip had already been included in the price. I  am uncertain if they do this to everyone, or if it was a move by the waiter to ensure a minimum 15% tip. He certainly did not deserve it. \n\nI feel as though my boyfriend and I were judged by the waiter upon arrival and were treated according to the prejudice of the waiter. I suppose we did not fit the image of clientele they desired. Their actions ensured that we will never visit again. I do not often write reviews of restaurants, but my experience was so astoundingly anxiety-inducing that I would like to share it with others, so that they do not experience the same thing.

My dad has lived here since 2014 but since his accident he was forced to move to an apartment more wheel chair accessible . He use to have a job that paid him $1,400 a week but because his co-driver fell asleep at the wheel almost coast this hard working man his life. This is 2017 and the staff at the Chandler Court Apartments located at 3800 w Chandler  Blvd, Chandler, AZ, 85226 has changed up but NOW they are charging us almost 2g, that is almost for a 2 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath for almost 2gs, that is $2,000. I have live in paradise. I come from Hawaii where a gallon of milk is almost $20.00. In Arizona they have NO RIGHT to tax a 2 bed room and 2 1/2 bath for almost $2,000. Here is why:\nThey are building a new apartment complex next to us that is FAR NICER and by FAR MORE SPACE and CHEAPER then what you can be charged at these bullshit apartments. We believe we are staying in the old leasing office, right across the way is 'what use to be' the gym. We are good people and refuse to break our lease, however if you are looking to sign a lease with these people are 3800 W Chandler blvd, please listen to our word and warning:\nIf you have a place under the umbrella or those spaces with shade, if someone parks there the apartments will do nothing about it, if you ask for one more day for your lease and your asking to pay for what you singed up for? Forget it you might as well pay an arm and a leg for what you want because unlike this place other places will grant what they promised you. The Chandler Court Apartments are nothing but lies. You are way better off some place else, we are moving ASAP, current looking for a House for $1,800 w/ a big yard, pool and 3 bedrooms. This places is NOT worth anywhere close to even $2,000.

I wrote that. \nBut it's true.\nListen to me, the pho here is aromatic, hot, rich, packed with layers upon layers of flavor. The solid selection of grilled meats is cooked to perfection by an old dad type, and this guy is for real. No BS. Take my advice and get the No. 15, the \"pork chop broken rice\" dish. \nI had it two days ago, and I can STILL savor the rich spices, the fullness, the spiciness and perfectly grilled flavor of the pork.\nMy wife and I have lived here for close to a decade. We've tried every last Vietnamese place in this valley. For a long time - in fact, up until we went here this past Saturday evening - we thought Jenni Pho was the best spot in town for Vietnamese cuisine. \nNope. Not any more. This mom-and-pop grille hits all the high notes for what you look for in a family-style Vietnamese place (and be nice to these folks when you go; they are some of the chillest people you'll meet in Vegas, and their table service is just superb). \nJenni Pho is now No. 2.\nThe Pho Vietnam Grille Express is the best Vietnamese joint in town right now, in late fall 2015.

I called to see if we could switch rooms and was hold for 20 mins just to find out there was nothing they could do.  I guess all the 1bed tower suites are at the end of hallways so I won't fault them for that.

Our 3rd day included no running water and the lights would periodically not work.  We also had an automatic shade that didn't work and needed to be repaired.  All these incidents happened individually and each time I called was 10-20 minutes I'll never get back.  For all the trouble and wasted time, they were only able to comp 2 nights resort fees and a late check out.  Pretty pathetic.

Opted for something \"better\" than the usual fast-food fare and dropped into the Claim Jumper for a late lunch.  Place looked about 1/2 empty inside so we expected to be seated right away.  Hostess told us 15 minute wait - REALLY?? for what?  So before she could pigeon-hole us into dining purgatory, we ducked into the bar and seated ourselves.  Albert was tending the bar and waiting tables.  Seems like he could have used another hand but he was attentive and pleasant.\n\nWe ordered a classic cheeseburger w/ fries and a citrus salad.  The cheese burger was nothing to write home about.  Ordered well-done and came out pink but by this time we figured it wasn't worth wasting the time and sending it back. The salad was a miserable combination based of iceberg lettuce and overpowered by onion, all swimming in dressing.  Bleah!\n\nCJ has a really nice setup, rich looking interior, well appointed, and attention to detail and design.  The problem here is clearly the management.  How can you expect to run a business (much less STAY in business) when you can't seat guests and serve in a half-empty restaurant?  I watched several families and couples who went through the same \"15 minute wait\" process the hostess tried to pin on us earlier.   NO management was in sight during our 1+ hour visit.  I noted a sign on the door to the patio that said \"Patio Closed\" - odd since there were several tables with guests dining out there.  Maybe there is no help to serve the patio either? \n\nSo to sum up the experience:  The food was lousy and the management is non-existent.  If this is the norm here, CJ isn't long for this location.  We won't be back.  Fast food in Avondale looks a lot more attractive now.", "date": "2014-03-26 23:29:49"}

This university offers a fairly decent educational experience and some of the professors are exceptional.\n\nThe student population is commuter centred. This kills the student life possible due to the development of parking and other automobile. The addition of the IC building has made this campus larger and gives students alternative studying area. \n\nI am guilty of this as well, but it must be mentioned that it can be near impossible to study in the library as the noise levels are extremely high given the theoretical environment. The only way to avoid this is to take refuge in one of the few study rooms which are always in high demand. \n\nThe food selection for busy students is also quite limited given that there are only 2 consistent options for coffee/tea and 2 areas for lunch/dinner meals. The monolopy that the food services division has over the selection of food is unfortunate as both  the student operated food outlets and the privately run outlets are open on weekdays only. The hours for the food outlets can be quite disappointing for the residence students as well. \n\nIt would be nice to see greater transit accessibility given that the core reason for the parking lots is the lack of faith in the TTC/UTSC linkage. Expansion in this area with LRT service would be hugely appreciated by students and staff.", "date": "2012-02-02 15:21:14"}

Basmati rice and Nan were ordered along with our meals. The shrimp in both dishes were cooked right, done but not rubbery. The spice and heat levels were spot on and to expected levels as ordered. Portion size seemed right for the price and while I did not have an issue with the rice being offered as a side I would prefer paying a bit more and having rice as part of the meal.", "date": "2018-01-19 13:39:54"}

No one asked how my food was. No water refill. My cup sat empty next to my plate for 12 minutes. I finally asked someone dropping off a dirty glass for a box. Still no acknowledgment from the bartenders, offer of a dessert or a check. The man across the bar was twirling his credit card and his date finally asked for their check. Another 6 minutes go by. I ask for a check and am ignored. I give up. Threw cash on the bar to cover the food and tax. Next time I'll get takeout.", "date": "2018-04-16 01:42:25"}

I was so happy to have found a place so close to where I work to get a good eyebrow threading done.  So happy, in fact, that I bought the \"Wax to the Max\" package with them that very day.  What is that, you ask?  You pay a set fee (for eyebrows it's $140, I think) and you can go in as many times as you want for a full year.  Great deal, I thought.  Unfortunately, not so...  I was a sucker.  \n\nFor those people reading this, please think about it:  I can now get my eyebrows done as many times as I want at Waxon without paying anything extra, and I STILL refuse to go back!  I mean, this review is brutally honest, so I can't go back now anyway.  That's how bad it is...\n\nThe thing is, once you buy the package, they have no incentive to keep you loyal.  Shima, the girl that does eyebrow threading at this location, progressively got worse and worse.  So bad, in fact, that they ended up crooked, with one side being much longer and thicker than the other.  As I started to notice how bad they were looking, I kept telling myself it was okay (I felt bad for having invested in the Wax to the Max package and was determined to get my money's worth).  However, after my last time at this place, I decided to just write it off.  So if you sense some anger in this review, that's where it's coming from.  I paid $140+tax for about 5 eyebrow threadings.  Kind of a rip off, right?  I imagine that anyone in a similar situation would feel the same. \n\nMore details on the eyebrow job...\n\nShima typical spent about 5 minutes on my eyebrows.  This isn't because she's quick and efficient - it's because she always misses spots and cuts them unevenly.  \"Always\" isn't an exaggeration, either - it's happened every time.  She doesn't use a tweezer to pick up missed hairs.  Then she'll draw the eyebrows back on with brow powder, and it looks terrible (really thick and obvious it's drawn on).  What's worse is it hides the bad job she does.  It's only when you get home and wash your face that you come to the sad realization that your eyebrows look like ####.\n\nIn all fairness, some pros:\n\n- Excellent online booking system.  Super easy and convenient for customers.\n- The place is spotless.  \n- Good location if you work downtown/in the PATH.\n- They've always been on schedule with appointments.  However, they don't seem to be that busy, so that may explain this.  \n- The brow powder, which I purchased, is good stuff when I apply it myself.\n- They offer you a Waxon branded bottle of water when you come in.  I'm mentioning this because I haven't been to another place that does this, so I guess it's a value-add.  Not because I care about getting a free bottle of water and it certainly doesn't make up for poor service.  \n\nAll the things I listed above are great, but so many businesses get caught up in the frills and forget the fundamentals.  Unfortunately, WAXON Wax Bar falls into this category.  \n\nI'm not usually very vocal if I get a bad job.  I just refuse to go back (and occasionally rant on yelp).  I was going to leave this one alone, but what's funny is Shima actually had the nerve to ask me to go on Yelp and review the place!  I mean, you're lazy with your service and you're kind of rude.  Why would I recommend this place to unsuspecting potential customers? \n\nActually, as a side note, go look at  the good reviews from people who have only reviewed once - these show up in the reviews Yelp doesn't recommend.  Is this because they had such a great job that they felt compelled to jump online and review, or because they were asked to?  It's misleading and very poor business practice to ask your customers for Yelp reviews.  You want good reviews?  Earn them legitimately.  Another point against Waxon.\n\nAdvice to fellow Yelpers - don't go here.  But if you do, DON'T get suckered into buying \"Wax to the Max\"- I mean it.  You may end up with a similar experience.  And considering how bad this place is and how expensive rent on the PATH is, I don't expect them to be in business very long anyway, so you may not get an entire year to use the package.  \n\nI can't trust them to do a good job, so even without having to pay anything additional, I won't go back.  My eyebrows finally look normal again, and I'm not risking it.  So yah, here is the review you asked for WAXON... I hope you read it.", "date": "2014-08-16 17:25:49"}

It had no Italian flavor. The small pizza wasn't soggy but still no flavor. The house made chips came out cold and super dark.  We sent the chips back. They sent more out that were exactly the same.  They appeared to sprinkled with seasoning, and still managed to taste like packing peanuts. The insult to injury was the price . Our bill was around 42$.

They take over machines, stretching areas, racquetball courts to take care of their paying clients.  They leave machines covered in sweat and leave equipment laying around instead of putting it back.\nThe top insult came recently when they suddenly cordoned off the stretching area and kicked everyone out because it was going to be reserved only for their clients.  What?? I guess that would be ok if they had another stretching area that didn't look like an after thought of throwing down a small mat in a corner.\nThis gym could be excellent given the great space and amount of equipment.

They of course were not.\n\nThey did respond to work requests, the few I had in a timely manner. But I credit this more to the fact that the Owners had a home warranty service in place.\n\nMy move out was A BAD experience.  I had the home professionally cleaned and the carpet, also was professionally cleaned.  I was moving across country and the company I used was emailing me the receipt.  By the time arrived 3000 miles away and reestablished internet service ... they had called in another company to RE-CLEAN the carpet which was absolutely beautifully cleaned by ZeroRez. \n\nIt was explained to me, that unless I provide a receipt ... they are required, by \"company policy\" to clean the carpets.  What ever happened to common sense and a persons ability to clean up on their own.  They weren't saying it wasn't clean, but it had to have a receipt.\n\nAs a former Realtor and Property Manager myself, I am extremely disappointed in this policy.  I am a single woman, I was NEVER late with my rent and I went well above and beyond in my efforts to leave the home in as good / better condition than when I moved in.  Admittedly,  there were some things that were accurately deducted from my deposit, but the CARPET was not one of them ... imho regardless of \"policy\".\n\nThe first contact was Carol Shambarger, the person who did the walk-thru and was responsible for processing my refund was Maria Hale and her \"supervisor\" is Sheena.  You might want to beware if you are considering doing business here!", "date": "2014-10-10 21:10:47"}

The drinks were actually topnotch, although not as large as I expected - this turned out to be fine because they were to be savored. \n\nWe ordered the Dunbarton Blue appetizer to share, and it was also good. The cheese was the highlight of the plate, but everything else paired well too. \n\nFor the main course, my girlfriend ordered the Beef Shortribs, and I ordered the Grilled Sturgeon. We were not impressed by the portion size or either dish, although the presentation was very nice. My sturgeon must have been waiting on the shortribs to finish cooking because they came out nice and hot, but the sturgeon was just barely warm by the time I took a bite. In regard to taste, the spareribs were excellent, and the gnocchi that accompanied them were prepared well also. I was not delighted by the sturgeon, and though I am not an expert on how to prepare this fish, I think it may have been undercooked (it was a little pink, and juicy in the center). Also, I didn't enjoy the crunchy chick peas very well, although I have never really enjoyed chick peas in any form. \n\nBecause we were still hungry, for dessert, we split the Sorbetto - the presentation was nice, but there are probably other desserts on the menu that would top this one (we ordered it only because my girlfriend has an egg allergy, and it was the only egg-free dessert option). I also ordered a cognac to top off the evening. I was still hungry, but I felt a little bit better about it after the cognac. \n\nBoth the atmosphere and waitstaff were pleasant enough. All told, the bill came to $85 plus 20% tip = $102. We both agreed that for this price, we would not be back soon.", "date": "2010-12-19 02:11:11"}

As a kid I thought Hollandaise sauce was this high-class, scrumptious, liquid gold that people would always praise. Then I had my first encounter with it and that was through a sauce packet. I know, big mistake, but I was a dumb nine-year-old. I concluded that it was disgusting and vowed never to try it again. But here I am, a proud hypocrite because yes, yes, and yes again, real Hollandaise sauce IS liquid gold. Especially the Hollandaise here. I have dipped my toes in a few other Hollandaise ponds since my vow of sauce abstinence and this place has them beat. This time I ordered the Blackstone eggs benny (poached eggs with grilled tomatoes, avocado, and pork/turkey bacon, on top of toasted English muffins, served with their Lyonnaise-style potatoes) and it was as delicious as can be. My friend's eggs were unfortunately a little overcooked (the yolk wasn't runny at all) which is unfortunate because I was championing this place to them for weeks. Other than that, my only wish is that they would add more gold--I mean sauce because there really isn't enough. \n\nGoes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: I'll be back again, but maybe to try something other than Eggs Benedict (no promises).\n\nTL;DR go here.", "date": "2018-03-21 17:09:00"}

So many cute things to look at inside, and the family who runs the shop are some of the most heartfelt and genuine people I've ever had the honor of meeting. The flowers are beautiful, the shop is lovely, and the people are beyond wonderful. I would definitely recommend going there even if you have to drive a bit, because you will not only have a great experience and maybe make some new friends, but you will be supporting a great small local business in Southern Nevada.", "date": "2017-10-10 05:17:37"}

The bar was rather full... Just a few empty tables. The bar top was empty so we attempted to take a seat... The female bartender come up so fast and demanded my ID before I could even sit down! I realize i look young, but god damn! So just to be an ass I ordered a water. Seriously give me a minute. \n\nNow, that entire experience had set the tone... We had to ask to order any thing... She would not check on us... Then she argued about a mistake she made! Her shirt was so worn her name was no longer visible  and the entire time we sat at her bar we didn't know her name. Since I was starving I order the poppers and a side salad. They brought the veggie platter, she rang in an $8 salad. When I clarified what i wanted she blamed the mistake on the kitchen (I could see on the screen what she had rang in). When my husband tried to justify the confusion, there is no $8 garden salad on the menu, she argued and was defensive. From that point we could hear her complaining about us to other employees! Classy. We again had to ask the manager for the side garden salad... He was told we didn't want it. WTF!!!!!! We eventually got the apology owed from the manager... Not our bartender. He did his best to rectify the situation, which is why we stayed. \n\nShe left with an attitude. John took over! He had one of those new shirts and a name tag! He did great! 5stars for john. When I ordered; he repeated and clarified my order. Everything met expectation, in the end. BWW isn't my favorite place to dine, but we were in a pinch... John was truly the saving grace tonight.

I thought it would be cool if they were around more when I need a spotter rather than having to disturb another patron who is, like me, just trying to enjoy their music and solitude while working out. OK I should mention there was a Sikh dude who I have seen on patrol so he was certainly available if I needed him but I have not ever seen anyone else. Also, I don't know what their routine is when it comes to organizing the weights section. Many gym users are sloppy and don't put back their weights and I think this could be resolved by more staff presence in that area. Finally, I don't go to the gym to watch TV but damn, when it's NHL playoffs, can't they have CBC and TSN available on the treadmills and elipticals? \nNow the good stuff...they spent money on changing the DISMAL lockers in the men's change room (can't speak for the women's). It's much nicer now. They have PLENTY of machines to use and the weights area is big! Compared with the massive Beacon Hill location, Northland is far superior for it's weight lifting area. Beacon Hill is better suited for all Goodlife's FANTASTIC classes! Any of the les mills classes are awesome and really make you feel like you are getting full value for your payments.

We arrived to this place at 2:45 on a Wednesday with a group of 7 people for a late lunch wanting a sandwich/salad. We were seated right away but from then on the service was horrendous. We waited for our drinks for 30 min before our waitress came by to take a order. Our orders were taken but then it took over ONE HOUR for our food to arrive. During this time no one came over to explain the delay or check up on us. The food arrived sporadically, so that by the time the last person's food arrived (a full HOUR AND A HALF after we arrived) the first few people were done eating. There was only two waitresses working the place, which was fine, but only one of them was actually waitressing, the other one was just standing behind the tea bar, cleaning and organizing stuff. Hello! If we are just waiting for 1.5h for stuff, at least you could come by and offer us to order drinks or something. She didn't even care! After our meal I went up to her on behalf of our group and asked to speak to the manager. She said \"the manager is in the back, is there an issue I can help you with?\" and I explained our frustration at the lack of service and waiting forever for our food and she actually argued with me! She said \"actually, we checked the tickets and it only took half an hour from the time you ordered till the food arrived.\" Sorry, but maybe that's because it took forever to order our food, and it was MAYBE a half hour until the first person in the group got their food, the last person didn't get theirs till 3:45pm.  And besides, why would you even argue that with me? Even half an hour is too long to wait for a SANDWICH! And why don't you just get the manager?! She went on to say that the manager was also the cook in the back, and the only one at that. Whatever, then at least let us know that before we waste forever at your place, or offer us some tea or coffee while we wait, it's not like you're THAT busy.  The one time I actually did need something (I got coffee as my drink, but there was no milk and sugar given with it) I actually waited so long that I eventually GOT UP and approached the waitress to ask her to hand it to me before I the coffee got cold.

Actually the overeating was also being done by a couple of groups of very obese people. \n\nAs for the food, the buffet I suppose was worth about $3.99. There are two salad choices. The bowl with the one I wanted, tossed with Italian dressing, was almost gone when I got there. It seemed like they never bothered to make a full bowl for the rest of the time they were open. The soup didn't look very appetizing. The pasta option was just elbow macaroni that looked like it had been tossed in canned tomato sauce. The pizza was fine. It didn't have any unique flavors. The combo I did like, surprisingly, was the mac and cheese pizza. No sauce, just cheese--orange the way it should be when dealing with macaroni. Figures I'd like the one choice that would make one's carb allowance skyrocket. I skipped dessert so no idea if their brownies and cinnamon rolls were any good.\n\nThe staff was nice though.

They can't replace just the hallway\nbecause they can't match the rest of the carpet, this seemed like a reasonable request and solution for both parties. The hallway is only about 6x12. \nWell, Empire wanted to Charge me extra to install the laminate unless I agreed to use one of only three samples they sent out by an installer on his way to another job not by a sales rep.\nThe three samples all looked the same Maple color and matched nothing in my home. When I tried to explain this I was told that's the only choices I get unless\nI want to pay extra. What a joke! After everything these people have put me through\nthey have the audacity to ask for more money!!!! \nI'm not sure how replacing all the carpet upstairs and the\ncarpet on the staircase is more cost effective for Empire than installing\nlaminate in a 6x12 area but nothing surprises me anymore with this company!\n This entire  process has been a nightmare from the start and I just want it\nfinished.

We figured, free food is always good food. Normal price for adults brunch is $18, served from 7am until 3pm Mondays through Thursdays. On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, the times are the same but the price is a bit higher. The price per adult is $22(brunch), which mean that the husband and I saved ourselves some money here. Dinner is served from 3pm until 10 Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Dinner comes at the cost of $24 per person (dinner).We did experience one brunch and one dinner buffet (dinner on Friday, brunch on Saturday) \n\n\nDinner:\n-Prime rib- it was ok. It didn't taste that great and the horse radish wasn't radishy.\n-Mexican rice- not bad. It was good with the beef with sauce that they had. I ate that together to give it more flavor since the beef with the sauce was a bit on the salty side. \n-I did not try the pizza but the lady seating in the table near us had a slice and I saw her take a bite. That poor slice of pizza was hard as a rock. She even tapped it on her plate and it didn't even brake. She came over and nicely informed me to stay away from the pizza because it's \"hard\". \n-Pasta- it seemed like it was sitting out there for too long since it was on the dry side BUT it was probably the tastiest thing I ate during dinner.\n-Mozzarella and tomatoes- none were good or tasted fresh   \n-Loaded potatoes- delicious!\nDinner experience: 4/10\n\n\nBrunch:\n-Their omelette station is great!! Ham, bacon, cheese, veggies, etc. The guy making the omelettes during our visit was genuinely nice and seemed happy to be working. He had a tip jar near his station and with that, we did tip him. \n-Pastries were a bit on the hard side. Not very fresh.  \n-Fruits are sweet, fresh and not too shabby. \n-Coffee- It surprise me that it was fresh and hot. I had no trouble getting more or them running out of it. \n-Potatoes were super good!\n-French toast- nothing special, not sweet or fluffy. It wasn't hard though so that was good. \nBrunch experience: 8/10 (the omelette saved it!!)\n\nLas Vegas has plenty of different buffets and restaurants of all ranges of prices to eat at. The particular buffet is pretty limited to what they have and the food is def not the best. I would say it's at a diner quality. If we did not get comp for the meals there because of our stay, I wouldn't have eaten there. This place needs lots of work in making it more inviting (colors are dull and decorations are kinda boring) and maybe a bit more on customer service since all the hostess' weren't the friendliest. I didn't go back for any seconds at all being that I wasn't tempted or wowed by any of the food here.", "date": "2013-12-03 00:06:19"}

This place was Phenomenal!!! Amazing!!! Delicious!!! Oh my God! I think I'm a vegetarian now... Lol. I might have to reconsider my life. Have I been living a lie my entire life? The menu itself is spectacular. They have the perfect amount of items on the menu for you to choose from. My husband and I looked at each other and we wanted to order the whole entire menu...haha. The waiter suggested that we order about 4 dishes to share and that their portion were generous, but we aren't average people so we ordered 7...lol (We should've listened to the waiter...they weren't kidding about being generous.) \n\nChicken gizzards. If your afraid on innards, don't be because if you didn't tell us we would have thought it was popcorn chicken. Crispy and super tender and juicy on the inside. Not your average innard. The sauce was delicious and the beautiful flowers added a nice fresh peppery last to the dish.\n\nWaxed bean aged cheddar and black bread. This was the first time I had waxed beans and it was pretty good. Crispy refreshing picked bites with savory cheddar and sweet bread. You know you nailed it when you think things just shouldn't go together, but realize that they do work together.\n\nStrawberry, rhubarb salad with glacier lettuce. This was one of my favorite dishes. The glacier lettuce was crisp fresh and lightly pickled and all the elements that I like were in the dish. Strawberries and goat cheese, who could say no?\n\nMexican shrimp was another one our favorites. It a little hard describe but what looks like a ceviche is nothing close. It's a must try flavor explosion. The flavors had many layers and depth to the dish and to just call it a ceviche is like a insult. All the flavors or savory, sweet, spicy, acidic and richness played a beautiful symphony on your palate.\n\nSocca and Squash was yummy too. \n\nRutabaga was really good as well, but since we didn't listen to the waiter... 5 dishes in the rutabaga was really filling. Out of everything, this was my least favorite but it was still really good.\n\nWe were at our stomach limits, but no matter what we HAD to get dessert. We were on the edge about two dessert and they recommend the grapefruit dessert. OMG it was so zingy but so good. Tasty creme sandwiched between beautiful crispy flaky layers.\n\nWe came back 2 days later because we wanted to try the complete menu. Unfortunately, to our surprise they changed the menu and we were not about to order 7 dishes this time around. We ended up ordering more mediterranean style dished this time around. The dolmas were great and huge. We made the mistake of order two chickpeas style dishes, which both were really good but in the end it was a bit too much chick pea overall. Coconut dessert was a pleasant ending to our meal.\n\nOverall, everything was delightful and service was so friendly. We loved how every single element contributed to the dishes and elevated even more. Each dish seasoned to perfection and put together with so much creativity and thought. This will be my go to spot when I'm in Arizona, but for now I'll be on the look out for something in Cali to satisfy my veggie cravings.", "date": "2018-06-19 21:31:29"}

Also, while some may say it is not fair to compare something like this to \"Disneyland\", I disagree.  Disney as the parent company who has \"theme park\" entertainment down to a science would never settle for the poorly executed design and management of this experience to exist.  No reason to re-invent the wheel- pool resources from the Disney parks gurus and fix the kinks.  Several of the activities inside the experience are actual activities AT Disneyland (in the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland) so there should be zero \"kinks\" with those, yet there are.\n\nCost: For our family of 4 (2 adults 2 teens) we paid $145 for the Marvel Experience plus an additional $10 for parking and shelled out another $20 for a souvenir photo.  So at $175 we are not talking about chump change.\n\nTime: We had tickets for Sunday December 28th at 3pm- the web said the experience would last 90-120 minutes. We were there for 3.5 hours ( i.e. 210 minutes) from 2:45pm until 6:15pm.  Approximately 60 minutes of that was actual \"experience\" everything else was standing in line.\n\nWould we do it again?:\nnot likely- at least not at the cost that it was.  Again it was nearly $30 per person\n\nPros:  It's Marvel so if you like Marvel you will be able to find something to like about it.\n\nCons: 1-interestingly enough kids 6 and under were FREE- which blows my mind because there sure were a TON of them and they take up a TON of time on the activities that those of us that PAID to be there are now having to wait for.  Due to the structure of the activities I believe every person who enters should be a paying ticket holder that would make it fair. 2- parking was an additional $10 (if you ever go to anything at Talking Stick you KNOW you have to pay for parking, this just always sucks- but at $10 per event they need to PAVE that lot- the dirt is getting old) 3- poor crowd management (read full review for details) 4- low value high cost (see full review for details of what $30 per person gets you)", "date": "2014-12-29 10:09:29"}

The place was already packed and the security guard lady was already giving people directions on how to order their tacos (unheard of if you go to the Tijuana location). The lines were not very clear and the menu was hard to see because of the d\u00e9cor hanging from the ceiling.\n\nI had my usual, tacos de carne asada. They looked and tasted legit! So the wait was worth it. Corn tortillas were handmade, salsa and guacamole on point and asada cooking over fire. I truly enjoyed my tacos and wished I had order 6 instead of just 4. I was very disappointed that they didn't have Mexican Coca-Cola or Fanta. They only have canned sodas and a fountain drink machine. Tacos were $2.25 each and the fountain drink was $2.00 (cheapest meal on the strip I tell you).\n\n***\n\nDecided to come back on Sunday before heading back home. Well, they say they open at 9 AM, but in reality they didn't start serving people until 9:30 Am ( I waited about 45 minutes outside...the smell of the asada I tell you). When we finally got to order I ordered 5 asada tacos, well I noticed that the guacamole was missing, so I asked where is the guac? The taco man replied \"we don't have any until the evening.\" I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they did not have an essential ingredient on their tacos yet again they still charged me full price. \n\nAfter a mixed experience, here is a rundown of my review and suggestions for the owner:\n\n- Food: Come over in the evening for tacos. I will never come at opening time, they were not ready to serve their clients. The wait is worth it later in the day when the tacos will be served with all the ingredients. Owner: Make sure you got EVERYTHING ready for your customers at opening time.\n\n- Service: The women who work behind the cash register and the cleaning ladies, they were pretty cold, no smile, no \"how you doing?\" The taquero, no smile, but hey, thanks for making me some delish tacos.\n\n- Location: Not enough area to sit inside/outside. I understand that it gets super crowded inside, therefore, have something like a long bar table area outside. I don't mind eating tacos standing up, but at least have a surface where I can put my plate and drink while I eat.\n\nThe way they separate the ordering areas by meat...please get rid of this. It causes confusion and unnecessary extra long lines for one type of taco. Instead, open at least three stations that serve all type of tacos, mulitas, etc. Also, don't have the security lady directing people where to go. I witnessed her running people out of the place by telling them that the line for asada was too long. Instead, have her do her job of making sure people don't steal tacos or get into a fight only. Also, clear the menu view...we get it, we love Mexico, but having \"banderitas\" hanging all over the place? obstructing the menu? not cool.\n\nOverall, I will return next time I visit Las Vegas.", "date": "2016-09-01 18:08:27"}

Wings were a great deal at $10 for 10 wings - can't go wrong with that.  Pizza bread was a bit of a letdown; had ordered it because some past reviews mentioned it as a delicious appetizer but I found it rather bland...literally like eating pizza crust.  We were given complimentary potato soup I think so that was a nice touch, quite flavourful.  Delivery was 1 hr. from time of ordering to door.

Laziza. The next week, I decided to join them in the debauchery of Makeout Mondays.\n\nLaziza is the epitomizes the all that a hookah lounge should be: dimly lit, DJ pumping out good music in the corner, a dance floor (which that night, was for vanity rather than for function), and a well-stocked bar with drink specials throughout the night. Our hookah had a mix of various tropical fruits (I believe mango and pineapple) and mint - boy was it smooth. I'm usually not a fan of hookah, but every time that hose came my way, I went to town. \n\nAs for the drinks, so many stipulations to the drink specials. My coworker was disappointed he couldn't partake in two dollar vodka drinks since they were for the ladies - a stipulation he'd like to dispute! Also, in order to get all of these deals on drinks, you have to order at the bar - a detail overlooked by our waitress when we asked her and subsequently ordered from her. However, I'll overlook the fine details, for this is the only place where the bartenders and waitresses know what a White Boy is. Having never heard of it, my coworker ordered me one - a Blue Moon, mixed with some orange juice and a shot of Amaretto. One of my favorite drinks definitely - I've ordered it elsewhere, but the proportions are never perfected as they are at Laziza. As the night progressed, my crazy coworker ordered a round of Lemon Drop shots. What a perfect way to end the night - that is, after some dancing and a few embarrassing photos afterwards.\n\nI now get the appeal of Laziza. Drink specials, dancing, and dim lighting leads to uninhibited actions, which in the case of my coworkers is both an excellent and dangerous thing. We left around 3 or 4, only to return to work at 6 - all of us inflicted with a terrible hangover and the desire to fall back asleep once we were off.

I kindly pointed out to Ms. Medina, that my work colleague (Tracy Childress) who was staying next door at your sister property Excalibur experienced a similar issue and they had no problem comping her resort fee for the inconvenience. Ms. Medina replied sarcastically \" I highly doubt that, let me look into this to see if your telling the truth\", and to my surprise Ms. Medina actually took it upon herself to research my collogues personal information (not sure if this is Luxor protocol?) in the computer system. In conclusion, my issue was not rectified in any manner whatsoever, a simple apology would have even sufficed.

The onion ring had an okay taste to the batter but I guess I was expecting crispy since it looked like it would be, but it was soft. Not soggy so there's potential in it. \nFruit was good and sliced perfectly for my 3 year old. The quesadilla was okay.

I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, basically I was one foot in the grave at the age of 31 years old. As of now I have lost 26 pounds weighting at 193 pounds and I been off my medication for 2 months and I have more energy. Alice is amazing trainer. I have work with different trainers before and none of them are like Alice because she gears your diet and exercise to your personal needs. I have one bad foot, 2 years ago I had foot surgery on my left foot to correct some flat foot issue. However, I could not get my foot back to what it was before the surgery. Since I been working with Alice the last 3 months my left foot is getting stronger. She helps me rehab my foot while losing weight. As she works with me to achieve my transformation. Her expertise in nutrition is phenomenon because I'm not very good in the kitchen and I'm lazy. My mom always tell me to get out of the kitchen before I burn it down. Therefore, Alice help me get the right nutrition in my body so I have more energy to workout. She gives me easy recipe to follow that does not involve the stove, so my mom does not get mad at me. She will suggest healthy microwave meals to eat for lunch or dinner and a smoothie for breakfast or a healthy meal replacement bar. As I get better understanding on cooking I could convince my mom to let me use the stove. That would be a different story. \n\nAs far as my workout routine I train with her 4 times a week and she is awesome and very professional. When I train with different trainers I know my routine for example it will be one day lower body and one day upper body, so my body would get use to the workout. My workouts with Alice is unpredictable because she changes it on me everyday for example one day I could be cross training from upper and lower to intense cardio kick boxing to suspension training, and the next day would be intense strength training on different muscle group to core training. My body reacts to this type of workout differently and it keeps it challenging for me and I truly sweat. Every time I train I will be drench in sweat and a lot of the exercise is low impact because of my foot. Wow! \n\nIf you have goals that you want to meet and want to achieve complete mind and body transformation then Alice is the trainer for you. She will keep you on your toes and make sure you stay on target base on your personal goals and fitness level. No matter what happens she always has an smile on her face to get you through your workout.", "date": "2014-09-14 06:44:02"}

The hostess informed us it would be about 1-1 1/2 hour wait.  We drove all the way from Brampton, so we said ok we'll wait.  The cool thing is, they take your phone number down, then a text is sent to your phone to confirm your wait...then when a table is ready, you get another text and then you have 10 min from when your text is sent to get to your table.  I think it's a good idea in case you don't want to wait in the cold as there really isn't a waiting area.  In exactly an hour, we got our text that our table was ready and it was game on.\n\nWe wasted no time at all, as soon as our server came...we ordered and the food was coming out nice and hot.\n\nWe ordered...\n1 lobster, 1 lb. of shrimp, 1 lb. of mussels, 1 lb. of snow crab with corn on the cob, raw oysters and Cajun fries.  All of our items that were served in a bag had the signature Captain's Boil seasoning with medium heat.  Anything spicier than the medium would have been unbearable to enjoy as the medium was spicy enough.  It was greasy, spicy, garlicky...finger licking good!  Everything tasted fresh and I can't really complain about the food.  We got all our seafood in the same flavour, but I still liked it.  Some ppl might get bored of it so switch up the flavours for different things, but I liked the captains boil seasoning on everything.\n\nThe Cajun fries were great!  Nice and crispy with the Cajun seasoning.  Now the oysters!!! I wish I had more, they were nice and big...hit the spot for my oyster craving lol \n\nIf you're scared to get dirty...don't worry, you get gloves, bibs and a whole roll of paper towel, but you might still get dirty lol\n\nThe downside to this place, is that it is a bit small.  They can't really do much about that but it's not a big restaurant.  I know they had a few tables downstairs and I think upstairs too.  Also, I asked if they had the shell/nut crackers for the crab and lobster but they didn't have.  I'm not sure if they don't have any or they didn't have any when I asked, but you would think they would have that as a necessity for cracking open the shells.  We got scissors and they don't work that well :( \nSo it was a bit of a struggle to break open the lobster claw.\n\nOur server was very pleasant and made sure we were good with everything from beginning to end.  Always topped up our water, which is a must with the grease and spice!\n\nThe food was great and I would definitely go again!  For the overall total of our bill and how full we were, definitely worth coming again!", "date": "2016-01-23 03:44:59"}

When I removed the bread from the pot, I found that there were swirls of cinnamon throughout it. I dipped it in the cream cheese & to my delight, I realized it was like a cinnamon roll. So so good.\n\nThe waiter recommended their fresh squeezed juices that are squeezed fresh on site.

I had booked this trip through hotels.com. There was no mention of the whole second part the building which included the club scene, little cafe and whatever else was attached. In the photos advertised it was a beautiful cheap room I was booking. Instead, I had a nightmare visit.\u00a0\n\nIt all began with registration, the most unprofessional set up they call a desk for checking in looked like it was a community potluck table until I realized this was where we were checking in. Had no problems with taller lady at the desk she was nice, no direct issues with the customer service. After finally checking in she directed us how to get to our rooms. This is when I was confused. We were not given a room in the hotel I had booked for. We were directed to walk past the pool, through the club and onto the foulest smelling elevator, that felt as if it would fall plummeting me to my death every time it moved. Once stepping off I was greeted with a carpet that I thought was designed with a dark strip down the middle then I realized it was just that dirty and ill maintained.\u00a0\n\nWhen we entered our room I just wanted to wind down. I went to turn on the lights but 2 out of 3 lamps had not been plugged in 1 wasn't even close to an outlet. It was just placed there and had the cord leading to nowhere while the nearest outlet was minimum 6 ft away, also a whole other outlet didn't even work. Are they for real? I went to go get ice but couldn't find a machine on the 6th floor. Not wanting to look around on other floors aimlessly, I tried to find a directory to show me where I could find it. There wasn't one for the stupid tower they placed us in. Clearly annoyed, I wanted to call the front desk but what a surprise I couldn't there was no phone! Which from a previous review I now read is due to \"get a way experince\" its stupid for when guests have issues they would like to have resolved. But hey, I could walk down the 6 floors of the tower, through the jumping club at 2 am, all the way to the front desk to ask for directions for ice. There was no 'do not disturb' to put on the door, so housekeeping woke me up at 9:30 am. The floor obviously hadn't been swept or mopped in weeks. My feet were black after taking a couple steps on the floor after changing. Paint was peeling off of the walls and ceilings. Signs in the parking lot are terribly marked for the hotel which is shared by the club. I paid for parking not knowing before hand they would supply a pass, and lost out on more money. This entire place was out dated, smelled like death, and cleaned just enough to impress the queen of dust mites and mildew.\u00a0\n\nMy overall experience with this place was awful. I wouldn't recommend anyone stay here unless you hate yourself or are college student who doesn't care about quality anything.", "date": "2016-12-13 01:45:46"}

Menu encompasses one order of uni per person. It's nice that not everyone at your table needs to order AYCE. \n\nCame early for dinner to avoid the rush. There's not many tables inside so if you get here later, you'll be waiting a while.\n\n\nFOOD: \nOh man. So much good nigiri!\n-- YUMMY Nigiri: Tuna, Uni, Yellowtail, Salmon, Seared salmon, Albacore, Unagi, Fresh scallop aka hotate, Salmon roe aka masago (and we added quail egg on top!), Amaebi aka sweet shrimp (came with the tails, which was a little awkward to eat). They also have a specials menu written on chalkboard so make sure to check that out. We tried the salmon belly, which was a little too fatty for my taste.\n-- Wasn't a big fan of the Super white tuna \n\n-- I didn't do any of the rolls, because I just wanted all that fresh nigiri! \n\n-- Hand rolls: Salmon skin roll was okay, not much flavor.\n\n\nDESSERT: Liked the lychee sherbet. Green tea ice cream was okay, I've had (and made) better.\n\n\nSERVICE:\nUgh. Service pretty much sucked here, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. It took foreeeeverrr to get any of our orders and sushi, and the waitresses didn't come to check on us so we had to wave and hunt them down to get more orders in. \nAlso, the sushi chef made one of my friend's hand rolls wrong TWICE!!! The waitress tried to argue with us until we showed her there was a shrimp inside instead of scallop. I'm really not sure how you mix up scallop and fake crab / shrimp....\n\n\nOVERALL:\nI'll be back when I'm in Vegas again!

I had very high expectations about this place and told the waiter this right off the bat.  I was not disappointed.  Neither mom nor I was interested in the dead fish tray.  I wanted to want the fish but it did not appeal.  We started with the Ligurian octopus salad, which was excellent.  If it weren't for the glowing reviews on Yelp I woulnd not have ordered it.   So thank you to everyone out there who takes the time to write these reviews.  Then we had the scallops on the bed of porccini mushrooms- outstanding.

The other pasta dish we ordered, the lasagne strips with sea food was equally perfect.   We ordered the chocolate cake with pistachio gelato, which was absolutely delicious.  A great end to a fabulous meal.  We opted to order wines by the glass so that we could taste different things.  We had the falanghina, vermentino, and chainti classico.   They were each lovely.  The service was very good.  We were there almost 3 hours and no one rushed us.  Our primary server was difficult to understand at first because he mumbled, but thankfully he perked up as the evening wore on.  Our other server was a delight from start to finish.  Overall a wonderful dinning experience.  Only draw back is the price.  It is crazy expensive.

We arrived around 12:48 PM and we were led to a table right away. It wasn't extremely busy but most tables were occupied. I ordered a hot cafe mocha, spicy chicken chipotle pasta (lunch special), and a white chocolate raspberry truffle. We were also served with complimentary breadsticks. They were warm and were great to munch on before our meal. \n\nThe cafe mocha was large but nothing too spectacular regarding the flavour. It was a standard mocha. The spicy chicken chipotle pasta smelled delicious when it arrived. I also added some Parmesan cheese on top. The crispy tortilla chips added an extra crunch to the dish and I enjoyed it. The spicy chicken was flavourful, and had a nice kick. There were also pieces of asparagus and green peas to add a little green to the dish. However, I thought the pasta itself were too firm, it would have been better if they were softer. \n\nI took a long time to decide which cheesecake to get because they just had so many! After much contemplation, I settled for the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. It was a big slice with whipped cream on top and on the side. It was truly delightful, it wasn't too sweet which I liked. At first I was worried that it would be too sweet but not at all. The cheesecake itself was smooth and creamy, with a great balance between the white chocolate and raspberry. I cannot wait to try their other cheesecake next time I'm in the States.\n\nService was great, the server dropped by to check up on us and made sure everything was good. Food arrived in a timely manner. I asked for a to-go cup for my mocha and I received one promptly. Overall, I had a great experience at the Cheesecake Factory.", "date": "2018-06-03 04:07:30"}

It was a pleasant Friday August evening, and luckily the rain stayed away since Darren and I had to wait outside for nearly an hour before a table opened up. The owner (?) of the establishment did keep checking on us and gave updates on how much longer he thought we'd have to wait. There is a menu posted outside the restaurant doors and we had plenty of time to mull it over. \n\nOnce seated we were happy to already have our mind made up as to what we wanted to eat and wasted no time giving the server our order. We started with the Steak Tartare: \"fresh, chopped rare seared fillet, pickled shallot, mustard creme fraiche, garlic brioche toast\". This is a first for me so I do not have anything to compare it to, but did enjoy it greatly. Just not sure it was worth $14.00. \n\nI then proceeded to order the Crab Pierogies. Lump crab meat, bacon, fresh corn, old bay grilled onions, sour cream. These were rather good as well! I didn't want to run out of the delicious crab stuffed dough pockets but alas I did! \n\nI also ordered a Moscow Mule, as I saw it mentioned in other reviews and was very curious. Ginger beer never tasted so good! Served in a copper mug! What with the price of copper I teased that I was going to take the mug home. Darren, who isn't much for booze, even enjoyed this drink! Reminding me a bit of ginger ale (YUM!). \n\nThere was no air conditioning and we both were sweating in the tight crowded dinning room before we even got our entree. The trendy crowd was loud and in no rush to leave A n' A. I passed the time singing along with the 80's pop tunes blaring from the speakers. \"Set me free why don't you babe. Get outta my life why don't you babe...\" Gotta love Kim Wilde. Good times! Be warned though, it is a little pricey.", "date": "2011-08-08 14:19:19"}

I haven't been in years, but I heard happy hour was decent, so I gave it another try. The atmosphere is nice - upscale casual bar area. Good for smaller parties of 4 or under. Not loud, good to actually talk and catch up with friends. Staff was attentive and did a last call for happy hour. So we ordered another round but asked for them to wait until we were done with our current ones. When we asked for our last one that we thought had be ordered, there was a mix up. They quickly grabbed a manager and rectified the situation. We still were confused with how they charged us for our beverages. When we questioned it, the bartender became short and snippy with us so we just let it go. I'm still unsure if we were charged correctly. \n\nAs for happy hour eats: decent portions, decent food. Nothing spectacular. \n\nAs for happy hour adult beverages: VERY weak. Taste good, just not much alcohol.\n\nI'm not sure I'll return.", "date": "2013-08-06 16:40:52"}

Took my daughters there on Sunday.  There were three other occupied tables in the entire place, and at least as many employees as there were customers so it's not like they were super busy. Ordered drinks and that's the last time we spoke to our waitress until we paid our tab. The restaurant was virtually empty but they still seated a group of people directly behind us instead of spacing it out a little. Waited about 20 minutes until the group behind us got their first round of food and we still had not seen the waitress to place an order. Said we were done and wanted to pay the tab and leave and the waitress and hostess were unapologetic and frankly couldn't care any less that they ignored us the entire time we were there. Used to be a great restaurant but they really spiraled into a sad empty place with terrible service. Went down the road to Black Angus and had a lovely time with great customer service and delicious food. We won't be making the Majerle's mistake again. It's sad to see a promising business lose sight of something as basic as customer service, and fail. Now I know why the place was virtually empty.", "date": "2017-10-26 02:35:38"}

The movie we saw was good. The sound was a little low in the beginning and it either got louder or I got used to it not sure which.\nIt is kind of funny that you sometimes get annoyed with up selling and little comments but then when you get very little interaction at all you realize that even though they have to up sell and say certain things at least they are interacting with you and giving you customer service. Here I just got basically Hi, what would you like, that will be $10 and that's it. Oh then if you bought some candy it is in racks in front of the counter which was obvious but not pointed out to me. Which for someone who has never been there before and not paying attention might wonder where their candy was. Also the obviously empty display boxes looked like they had all been stepped on before being put in the case about 20 years ago.\nI'm sorry to say I think I will stick with the other movie theater in town.

Always a good amount of crab legs, the claws are pre-cut for easy opening and they provide the aluminum silver crackers too. \n\nIf you're not into seafood there is a large selection of meats such as short rib BBQ, baby back ribs, and chicken skewers\n\nThere's a miso soup machine! Fresh Udon too!\n\nFair selection of deserts and a chocolate fondue fountain.\n\nHuge line outside when they open at 5:30 p.m. however the small restaurant does a great job of squeezing everybody in with enough tables for everyone and short wait time. I would also give this place five stars if they increased their hours and was open longer for their lunch/dinner times.\n\nFamily of 4 and one kid (who was under 4ft and if over 5ft pays a slightly higher rate) cost $180.00 dinner rate without tip. If you have a party of over 8 people you should make a reservation. No Reservations are needed if less than that. All in all good customer service buy all the waiters and when you need to pay everything is quick and easy.", "date": "2018-04-03 02:08:44"}

All honesty they have a lot of room to improve as this is just there soft opening. However the only reason why I would rate this as low as it is, is due to several factors that really need to improve on.\n\nFood: We ordered a variety of things on the menu. First off the drunken chicken, we got it in both the mild and the spicy version. Was definitely not a fan of the the mild version as nothing really stood out from the dish. I do however thought it was cooked well as the chicken was not dry. \n\nArancini takoyaki was definitely the major highlight of this evening as a really enjoyed every aspect of this particular dish. Using risotto was definitely something I didn't expect and it paid off well.\n\nCrab cake tostada was pretty good in terms of flavoring, however felt that the dish itself was overpriced.\n\n48 hour Short Rib Donburi was pretty good. I wouldn't pay that much for any Donburi type dishes normally but I would say I had no grip with anything on this dish. The short rib was tender and the jus from the short rib was good.\n\nKimchi seafood paella was the most underwelming dish of the night. From the looks of it I expected something with a bit of spice and kick to the dish, sadly it was bland and undesirable. My friend also found a mussel that definitely smelled rancid, however we just kicked it to the side and moved on to dessert.\n\nFinally, the reason why I came in to the restaurant in the first place, Souffle Pancake. As one of the few people experimenting with the craze, I had to see what the hype is. Definitely was below expectations but I definitely found the dish good. The ice cream that comes on the side was also good. \n\nService: Again I know it's soft opening so you will find kinks... But really as a place to be considered upscale, you really need better service then this. A cafe/restaurant that seats about 30 In capacity and your servers are just standing around is unacceptable. \n\nThe bar of standards should be set higher if your trying to have that quality standard and at the moment it's just not there. I shouldn't be waiting for water top ups and quality checking happens just at the end of finishing the dish when I can clearly see the servers just standing around. \n\nAlthough the servers seem friendly enough, clearly there is a lot of inexperience and I'm writing this mainly due to hoping things improve.\n\nAmbiance: Bit too bright, nice decor, definitely have that cafe vibe down.\n\nOverall verdict, I can see this place doing well, food is decent and there is definitely a lot of creativity and work behind the BOH team. Food was presented excellently and while some dishes are a hit or miss, I definitely think it what standing out for them. What suffers ultimately is the FOH team as it's comes off more like your typical run of the mill Go For Tea then it is a upscale dining experience. Definitely not opposed to recommending them to other people, but I will say let's set higher standards for them to grow.", "date": "2018-04-18 05:32:03"}

I'll usually get a coffee to start and then order the Chicken Club.  I know that sounds so incredibly boring, but honestly it's delicious.  It comes on a slim, tender french stick baguette, chopped into three decent sized portions.   The sandwich comes topped with swiss cheese, deliciously seasoned grilled chicken, bacon, red pepper mayo, salad greens, tomatoes and red onions.  And on the side, some of Utopia's golden crispy perfect fries.

Last month I was frantic because at 10:00pm my dog had what looked like an infected bug bite that was driving her insane with itching.

Check out some of the other indie coffee spots in the valley like Lux, Gold Star, Gill's, Lola or Cartel for some ideas. They're all indie coffee shops, but they all manage to do it in a really distinct and unique way that sets them apart from the big chains and from each other. \n\nAfter my great experience tonight, I truly believe Desert Eagle has a ton of potential and I can't wait to come back and see how the shop evolves.", "date": "2016-02-09 10:23:00"}

Tasting the sauces -- 5 of them -- was great. I don't know if this is offered to every new customer but it should be. The one with the Habernero was my favorite and really well balanced. The Eastern style sauce was good, actually very good, but just a tiny bit on the sweet side (as Bob Garner said). But seriously, ask for the sauce tasting if you don't get it; they arrive steaming hot.\n\nStars of the show: The fatty brisket. You must request it well marbled, and it beats anything I ever had in two driving trips across Texas. Next in line would be the ribs. Request them without sauce and use the sauce tray you earlier requested. They were moist, tender, and not too much char. Third star was the sausage. It's a rather sophisticated blend with a natural casing; they don't grind it there but they smoke it there.\n\nThe hush puppies are fine, though probably started out as a mix. On this day, the macaroni and cheese was just too dry and one dimensional; I would not order it again. The collards were great, without as much grease as my grandma used.\n\nI do not recommend the fine chopped pork. The flavor is not quite there and the chop is too fine for my taste, but I've met old barbeque masters who prefer it that way. The vinegar/pepper sauce wakes it up for sure.

I had never eaten there before and was looking forward to it.  The restaurant  had few customers when I arrived.  Appetizer platters had already been ordered.  The term \"platters\" was quite an exaggeration.  I would have used the term \"salad plates.\"  But, the appetizers, served with a green sauce and a relish listed as 2 on the heat scale, were delicious!  I ordered Vegetable Karma, described as grated vegetables and cheese in a cream sauce.  I specified number 4 on the heat scale, which went to 5.  It came with rice, and I also ordered garlic naan.  The heat was nice, but the meal did not stand out visually or flavor wise.  But, I did adore the little copper pot used for presentation.\nNow, one would think if a restaurant was expecting a group of 10 or 12 that there would be adequate staff that night.  One server for the entire place.  Not sure how many chefs were in the kitchen, but it took a long time, an hour or greater, to be served.  Other tables seated later received their food, ate and left before we did.  It was as if we were guests in the home of someone who didn't plan ahead.

The first problem is they apparently reserve each table for the full night.  So, despite a table being booked for 8pm, they refuse to allow earlier reservations.

The hostess came out and rudely stated they didn't open at six, and she would not let us in from the cold weather because they were having a staff meeting.  A more courteous response would be to have allowed the five people waiting to wait in the inside vestibule until 6pm.  Essentially this restaurant has all of the pretentiousness of a fine French restaurant, without that quality of food.\n\nWhile the food was fairly good, it was far from outstanding.

Everything was delicious.  The plates were exquisite - almost too pretty to eat.     \n\nFor entrees, we had the pepper crusted filet, hanger steak, and sea bass.  They use the term entree loosely  as it is still a very small portion.  For example, my bass was a 4 oz. sliver with 6 artichoke hearts and 1/2 whipped potatoes.  Aside from size, it was flavorful and lovely.  The whipped potatoes both look and taste like pure whipped butter.  They are unbelievably decadent.  I'm not sure there is even any potato in there!  The filet was the standout.  The meat was absolutely sublime.  Nothing less than expected from the $72 price tag.  \n\nThe one  major disappointment was the bread.

Halal guys is good for:\n\n* A cheap lunch. Less than $10 per plate (before taxes). Compared to my other meals on the strip, this was a steal. A drink at the taco bell cantina sets you back $10. \n* An afternoon snack. Plates come in two sizes - small and large. Go small for snack time. \n* A quick dinner. No one hour waits here as the food is made pretty and served pretty quickly. \n* After a night out. Opened late and just enough protein, carbs, flavor, and a bit of grease to hit the spot (and slow down the absorption of alcohol) without being too greasy. Ask for more rice and less lettuce if you need more carbs. \n* After a weekend of excessive eating. Everything is pretty fresh and the bit of lettuce and tomato help to lighten the meal. \n\nI got the combo meal, which is my usual go to at halal carts. The meat was in bigger chunks than I expected, but tasty and not too dry. The rice was flavorful and fluffy. The pita was alright, but I don't usually care for the pita anyway. I did make the mistake of putting on too much red sauce and had to make multiple trips to the soda fountain for more water. \n\nIt's not an exact replica in tastes and experience of the original Halal Guys and cart on a street corner in NYC, but I guess that's what happens when you can't port the water and years of flavor built up on the cart across the country. It's close enough and a great addition to the Vegas food scene.", "date": "2016-11-16 06:59:45"}

I had the pumpkin soup to start and it was delicious.  It had Carmelized onions and pumpkin morsals with some type of crispy on the outside crouton. It was also covered with delicious melted mozzarella.  For dinner I had the filet tenderloin with house potato chips and a mushroom rocker fella.  The steak was cooked to perfection and so tender. (Medium rare). I had a lovely mushroom sauce to go with it.  The chips were light and crunchy with a nice garlic salt flavor, and the mushroom rocket fella was superb.  For texture eaters, this place is Divine! The rocker fella consisted of a mushroom stuffed with bacon, crispy crumbs, and some type of filling. It was soft and crispy and crunchy... Yum! My friend shared with me her cheesy garlic mashed potatoes, which were so soft and fluffy (as opposed to the usual starchy rough mashed potatoes at restaurants).\n\nTo end, my friend was given her choice of a birthday Sunday, and she chose the caramel turtle ice cream. The ice cream was rich and sweet, filled with candied nut morsels that were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe speed in which we got our food was fast!

There are several posters around the restaurant sporting claims that fatburger ingredients, flavours, freshness, etc.. are better than other burger chains in Canada but I'm not sure I'm convinced! \n\nThe burger itself probably gets the lowest score, the patty was a bit dry, unfortunately and the toppings and bun weren't particularly amazing, although they do offer a nice selection of free toppings, including onion rings. The fries were ok, despite the claim that they're hand-cut, skin on, they actually kind of tasted like from-the-freezer fries. They weren't terrible, they just didn't have that rustic fresh fry taste like you'd get from a chip truck. The saving grace were really the chicken strips, a bit costly at $10.50 for 6 pieces, they are hand breaded right in front of your eyes and fried to a golden crisp. They were flavourful and crunchy on the outside and the chicken was moist on the inside. We tried the honey mustard and honey garlic sauces and both were above average, the honey garlic was particularly delicious. If we were to go back I'd go for those. \n\nThe service was a bit strange, I'm not sure if the girl at the front desk was new or had an English language barrier but she had to keep asking another associate for help whenever we asked for anything which slowed the process a bit.

That was not was I was personally looking for. Finally he tried to sell me a DIY polishing machine that he supposedly invented himself because he is a chemist, and instead of telling the specs he gave me some sales pitch how it \"circulates instead of rotates\". That was probably a salesmans way of describing what ordinary people would call an orbital polisher - that is not unique but he tried to present it as such which I percieved as dishonest. Sorry. So instead I went and waxed the car myself with high quality Meguilar stuff I got from Walmart at around $30 and now it is nicer than new!", "date": "2016-06-11 21:48:53"}

I was a nursing student in the Urban Family Health Team. The nurses, doctors, and allied health teams have taught me compassion, understanding, and leadership in health care. When I first came to them, I was a bit worried. I accidentally labelled the hospital as old and conservative Christian because all I saw was a very old Catholic hospital. I was very incorrect on my assumptions. I truly apologise. What I learned is to see people as people and not their diagnosis. I saw patients who did not have any money, some did not have proper health insurance, some were people had refugee status. The Family Health Team saw their patients as people and did what they needed to do to take care of them. Before anyone gets upset about people who did not have proper insurance for care, I was advised that the Church helps out these people that require medical attention. I used to live in a bubble. I did not see or understand people that were living in poverty--I will admit that I still have a lot to learn. However, they bursted my bubble and showed me how many people live in our incredibly wealthy nation. I learned to see people and real conditions. I learned to see people and not labels or diagnoses. I learned to care about people.\n\nI was also a patient at SJHC. The nurses, doctors, and allied health were very caring during my stay as a patient. I found it very interesting that they did not have as much as several other hospitals in the GTA, but they efficiently used the resources that they did have on hand.\n\nI have heard a lot of people discussing how the facility is incredibly old. And they are correct, but I look at the effective health care and compassion of the people who work at this hospital. I find that effective health care and compassion is more important than brand new and fancy beds with flat screen TVs. At the end of the day, I felt that I had really good care as a patient, and I had really good education as a nursing student. I am now a registered nurse, but at another hospital. Now that I have experience as a registered nurse, I can still say that I have a very soft spot for this incredible hospital and their staff.", "date": "2018-02-25 02:05:13"}

I wanted it cooked medium rare and my friend wanted medium so they actually cut it in half and we got our own mini which was nice. We added on the garlic butter mushrooms but they put them in a dish on the side which was weird. Like I wanted them added onto the steak, which I thought was implied with the term \"add-on\". But whatever. \n\nAll in all, the food was fabulous. The service was not. We waited so long for everything. It seemed like we had a few servers not just one. Maybe her section was overly busy? I didn't get a drink I ordered and she didn't even apologize just said, \"oh I forgot to put it in\" and walked away.

There was only one group in front of us , yet we waited over fifteen minutes to be seated and this despite the fact there were empty tables available on the riverview side.  Hostess claimed they didnt have enough servers in that section, so we had to wait for someone to leave on the streetside.  After viewing a quick table top wet towel smear, we were finally seated at that table.   Noticed that the carpeted floors were disgusting throughout the room...food all over them.\n\nAfter almost 10 min the waitress breezed by us and said \"i'll be right with you\".  Never saw her again.  After another 10 minutes a couple from next table advised, \"you seem like nice people...take our advice and get out while you can.\"  They said that they had long wait on a table, long wait to place order, long wait to get food, no service after food arrived, and yes, even a long wait to get their check.  They had been there well over an hour and a half. We thanked them and decided to leave.  Another table saw us leaving and they too left.  \n\nAs we were leaving, a young man appeared and asked what he could offer us to stay.  He began providing rationalizations as to why the service was so poor and actually followed me all the way to the door asking if we wanted a different table.  We asked if we could get better service, to which he had no response.  He then actually offered us coupons for our next visit.  Really?  We came in for a meal, not charity.

My husband responds yes please. \n\nSo she remakes them. Lo and behold, burnt yet again. So he returns and says I'm sorry but these are also burnt. The barista says well I remade them. Ok and? If they are burnt I do not care how many times you remake them. Burnt is burnt. So my husband requests a refund. \n\nWe wait for our little one to finish her pretzel and her milk. She is very happy and satisfied. The we go upstairs , she picks out a stuffed puppy and we leave. We are putting her in her car seat when we both realize she no longer has her Nintendo 3d DS. We race back just knowing it's gone for good. My California mentality kicks in, just knowing someone pocketed it and took it home. I'm trying not to panic. I got to the register and ask if anyone has turned it in. She guides me to the customer service kiosk lost and found. I ask if someone turned it in. The girl says yes, the woman just brought it a few minutes ago saying some little person was going to be extremely upset that it was gone. \n\nI almost cried. I wish I could thank this woman in person. Honest, compassionate, and caring. She's right. This little one is a sensitive little soul. And the meltdown that would have ensued, along with the genuine heartbreak were all averted, thanks to an honest person. \n\nIn California had something like this happened we would barely have turned away from where it was left and someone would have snatched it and ran. And I know a good many people personally who would not have done The right thing. \n\nIt's reaffirmed my faith in humanity and honesty. I cannot thank this person enough and wish I had been able to in person. And thank you to the staff in B&N for also being honest. Amazing!", "date": "2013-10-13 23:51:29"}

Now I know why there was a line out of the door! I didn't mind the wait, but if you're impatient... this place would probably not be the best place for you. But I have to say, it was worth the wait! I ordered the Hurts Dozen, which is the dozen where the staff picks for you. It was $12 (more than a dozen of Dunkin' Donuts) but my kids loved it! It is sooo good! The menu is self-explanatory but I think some of the other customers didn't really understand it. I really liked the guy that picked my donuts, he had a sweet little accent and was really nice! He had a tough crowd though and I felt bad for him. My sister and I lightened up the mood and ended up having a good time when we were there. The place was nice, very easy to find, the service was fast, and the donuts were so good! I like their idea and their setup! I will definitely come back! There was also an upstairs, but I didn't go up there so I don't really know if it's seating or how it looks up there. I didn't feel too adventurous. But I would guess that's where people can go to sit down and enjoy their donuts. There are a couple of seats on the main floor as well.

So I see that the other reviewers on here are liars, don't know what flavour is, because this place, is lacking in that department. My girlfriend and I went for dinner, it was our first time there and our last. I ordered a shrimp roti, she ordered rice and peas with some strange looking chicken (asked for fried), and we each got a double and a bag of cold, stale pholourie. \n\nThe doubles were good, if I were judging the meal based on the doubles alone, I would have given 5 stars. \n\nSo the shrimp roti:\nThe curry wasn't flavourful enough, no heat, no kick, just watered down yellowish brown sauce. The person who wrapped the roti did a terrible job, I had five bites of plain roti before I could get to the curried shrimp and potato. \n\nThe rice and peas/chicken:\nThe rice was very bland. The chicken was under-seasoned and didn't smell appetizing. The only enjoyable part of the dish was the side salad. \n\nThis was my girlfriend's first time trying Trini food at a restaurant and as a Trini man, I am ashamed to have taken her to this place.  She said the best part of the dinner was the bottle of Ting she had to wash down the flavourless food. \n\nI would not ever go out of my way to go to this restaurant. If you're in the area and feel for a double then sure, but don't spend money on anything else on the menu.", "date": "2016-02-20 03:53:05"}

All you can drink mimosas are available for an additional $15 or all you can drink bloody mary's for $12.\n\nOne can't-miss item is the poached egg on pastrami hash. The potatoes were deliciously crispy and light in all the right places and the chunks of pastrami added a wonderful saltiness and savoriness to the dish. Mix in the poached egg after slicing it open and together it's a dish you won't forget.\n\nThe flakiness of the pecan sticky buns topped with the sweet and smooth caramel sauce creates another winner. The lemon ricotta pancakes come three per order so you may want to share. They're light and fluffy with a subtle lemon flavor. The Monte Cristo, the stuffed French toast, and the cheese blintzes are two other dishes that my wife and I had no trouble finishing.\n\nThe Hollandaise on the surf and turf was a bit too eggy and thick for my liking, but considering that was the only dish I wasn't crazy about it's easy to overlook that one misstep.

It was a nice drink on a nice summer day. I enjoy their house rolls. The Geisha A Go Go roll was delicious, wrapped in their \"Geisha Green\" soy paper with a jalapeno sauce. The Gaijin roll, a specialty roll here, was yummy. It was an interesting take on a chimi, topped with their chipotle sauce made it super yummy. I really enjoyed the calamari here, again paired with the chipotle sauce for dipping, and the teriyaki ribs, which were so good and tender. The fried rice is really yummy as are their other apps. The ones I mentioned are just my favorites and ones to try. The apps here are a good portion size, unlike some other places, where you can actually share with people. \n\nIt's a good place for food and the environment is really awesome!

During service, a few missed orders but it's AYCE so it's forgiven. I do wish there was a hostess so I wasn't walking in, awkwardly asking questions and for a seat. With that being said, I wouldn't say it should stray you away from trying this place. \n\nHere's the pros: great food, great options for an AYCE. For a casual eater, there's probably a lot of items you've never tried that they offer and that is a good thing. I, myself, am quite experienced and enjoy a variety of things and this place was able to offer that for a $25 ish AYCE (dinner). It is Korean owned so I enjoy the quality/variety of items offered.\n\nThe chef (he calls himself the rookie), Siko (pronounced See-ko), was nothing short of awesome. I ordered Saba, Hamachi, and Ika to start. The female server came and suggested the Tuna Poke and I also ordered an agedashi tofu along with it. I was content. The rice was tasty but a bit wet (nigiri fell apart a few times). But that's okay because most place don't offer flavorful sushi rice. I was most impress by the fish, it had a soft and fresh texture which I enjoyed immensely. The tuna poke was flavorful and the agedashi tofu was alright. I followed up by ordering uni, amaebi, sake, and hirame nigiri with an order of pork belly and fresh oyster. The sushi chef did forget my hirame but it did not faze me as I was content with the offerings served. The pork belly was flavorful and served on a sizzling plate (tasted like Korean marinaded pork belly). The fresh oyster was delightful and composed with massago, chopped scallions, spicy sauce (sriricha?), sweet sesame oil soy with a touch of yuzu (I assume). The uni was creamy. I did not care for the sweet shrimp and they don't fry the head unfortunately (bummer!).\nI then ended it with a spicy tuna handroll, hamachi roll, and seaweed salad. The owner then served up another order of oyster. I ate everything with a few bites of rice leftover. Keep in mind, this is how they get you in AYCE, they fill you up with rice so stray away from rolls if you want your money's worth.\nAt the end I was full. I had a nice conversation with the sushi chef. The owner talked to me for a little and the server was sweet offering me ice cream.\nI tipped the house 22% and another $5 to the sushi bar because I was satisfied. \n\nAll in all, don't judge it by the front. It's a decent hole in the wall. I will visit again very soon.\n\nA few things to help: all Front-of-house should introduce themselves and be more attentive. Apologize for missing orders even though it's usually not a big deal. But very minimal things to the whole experience, I enjoyed it very much. Thank you! \n\nYou should definitely try it!", "date": "2016-12-30 11:07:40"}

I also noticed their low pricing on an oil change and took advantage of it.\n\nThe oil change was done in about 30 minutes. I had a brake light out and asked how much that would be. He mentioned the part being about $6 and labor being $16.59. I passed on that and did it myself in one minute. \n\nOverall not a bad spot for a quick, last minute oil change. \n\nI personally would not recommend them for state inspections. During our oil change they did a brief inspection. I mentioned our car was being inspected the next day. The guy said there's no way it will pass inspection. He mentioned we had a bald tire (lies) and another one on the verge of vecoming bald (maybe). He said that the rotors need replaced. (I knew they were fine since brake pads were just replaced and mechanic said rotors are good). I left crying because I was nervous for inspection now.

When the rest of the food came out(Korean pork belly with house salad), she didn't bring the side dishes like we had last time, I waved her down and asked if we get them. She said not with these dishes, okay I assumed the pork belly was a entree considering it was 13$ and on the front of the menu close to where the entrees were and it didn't distinguish above what it fell under. She said it would be extra for the side dishes and didn't explain for which ones or anything.

We sat down, looked over the menu and got chips & dip, bulgogi fries, bulgogi taco, chicken taco and kimchi fried rice wth a fried egg on top. \n\nEverything was UHh-may-zing. bulgogi tacos came on corn tortilla with really fresh pico de gaillo type of toppings--diced tomatoes, white onions, cilantro, red and white cabbage.  We asked for hot sauce and they brought over a spice tray, which is amazing for us spicy-hot lovers. I was expecting Tobasco sauce but they came out with red chili mix sauces (total of 4 on a tray). We tried every single one of them and they aren't too spicy but they still have some kick to it and were very flavorful.  Bulgogi fries came out with fries at the bottom, topped with bulgogi and melted cheese and the usual toppings. SOOOO good. the fries weren't soggy (yet) and it came with jalapeno peppers, which was an awesome bonus. The Kimchi fried rice was spectacular. It came out a little later since they cook everything to order.  It was hot, it was spicy, kimchi was good and slighly crunchy, and it was really delicious. I highly recommend this dish.\n\nThe server was very attentive to us and everyone else there. She was really nice and checked up on us frequently. It was about 3pm when I arrived, so perhaps they weren't all THAT busy during that time.  But people came trickling in.  I saw that other people ordered burritos, which looked good from afar.

There's a lot going on, but the main thing is that the performers keep the crowd engaged from beginning to end.

They asked if I wanted to get anything else done, but I politely declined, because I was in a bit of a hurry. I guess because they were not going to make much money out of me, that no one wanted to help me. They took in the person that was waiting before me, then 2 other customers came in AFTER me who they helped right away but they kept me waiting. Then finally the receptionist asked if it was okay if I waited another 30 minutes because the available technician \"did not know how\" to remove nail polish. I replied, no it's not okay, and a nail technician doesn't know how to remove gel polish (soak my nails in acetone)?! So I waited about 15 more minutes and they ignored me so I walked out of there.

Now, I'm just sad I didn't discover it while I was living there! I keep thinking of how many more times I could have visited the place. I stopped by here with several hours to kill before my flight home. I only got the day pass, as I had splurged most of my spa budget away a few days before at the Mandarin Oriental. I was in love with this place as soon as I walked in the door!\n\nPros:\n\n1. The water facilities here are amazing! I think this is what makes this spa so awesome. There are 4 pools total. In the main area, you will find one hot, one cold, and one warm-ish pool. There's a rain-style waterfall that cascades into the hot and cold pools. This makes an incredibly relaxing sound that you can hear through the whole room. The warm-ish pool has jets and lighting that changes color. Further back in the spa, you will find a large, round classic jacuzzi.\n2. The vibe of this spa is amazing. The whole thing feels like some sort of hidden cave oasis. The colors are neutral throughout with tan sandstone on the walls and purple lighting. It is incredibly relaxing.\n3. This spa is huge, and the layout is really wonderful, as other reviewers have mentioned. It can accommodate a lot of people, yet areas are sectioned off so it feels a little more private.\n4. There's an abundance of juices, teas, coffees, and waters. They also have pretzels, apples, and oranges. Possibly some granola, as well?\n5. All of the spa attendants here were very friendly\n6. The showers are neat, because you can adjust it to have water come out of the sides of the walls. There's water at every angle!\n\nCons:\n\n1.It gets crowded. It wasn't terrible, but I was there in the afternoon on a Tuesday. I would hate to see this place on a weekend.\n2. The Arctic Room was a little over-hyped. The \"snow\" flurries weren't super noticeable, but I suppose this chilly room is a nice break between the sauna and steam room. \n\nOther info:\n1. They have a sauna and steam room as well. These are nothing remarkable, but they serve their purposes well.\n2. This place is clothing optional, as are many spas on the strip. However, this was the first spa where I actually saw people take advantage of that policy. I think half the people using the facilities were naked. So just be prepared for that if nudity is something that makes you cringe!\n\nOverall, I feel like everything just flows so well at this spa. The environment is so relaxing! I have been to quite a few spas, and this was my favorite. I can't wait until I can go back!", "date": "2013-03-25 04:29:28"}

This observer further expressed dissatisfaction with their practices here at this Waffle House, as this observer frequently eats here. Not once did the owner or manager ask his staff to stop what they were doing and go wash their hands, nor did the owner himself, quite a disappointment and disgusting. \n\nOverall, this experience was very unprofessional and a hospitality nightmare!

Apparently he thinks giving a place a second chance only to have them make the exact same mistake is hilarious. At this point I'm furious and after he waves me in, he nonchalantly giggles through telling me that there was already one screw missing so that's why it came off. Well clearly something can be done to keep it on there because it wasn't dragging before my oil was changed and it isn't dragging now after I had to bring it back.

I then spent the next two weeks going back-and-forth pointing out all the various errors and trying to get them corrected. The final kicker was that on the two days before closing, I was sent a final statement that was actually the very first preliminary statement that was full of errors. I then had to deal with someone else in the agency to get them all corrected so we could get things moving. It was like pulling teeth. Or, maybe it was like having teeth pulled, I don't know which.\n\nBasically, you should avoid this company at all costs.

With a hit-and-miss menu and tall asking prices, it's obvious that Byblos still has much to learn after nearly 28 years in business!  \n\nThe restaurant itself is well dated and the atmosphere inside generally feels like a retirement home lobby with booths for seating...booths that are very worn and borderline uncomfortable.  While the decor could use a serious smack with the pretty stick, the smaller size of the restaurant does make it fairly cozy for family dinners and small gatherings.  \n\nThe older lady and gentleman that run the place are pleasant and good natured, but can be difficult to understand.  Obviously, this has caused several of the negative reviews, but their heavy accents do add something to the experience beyond just the obvious confusion.  One thing worth noting is that they are their own waitstaff and they clearly don't move as quickly as they used to, so service can be a bit slow if there are more than 3 or 4 tables to tend to.  \n\nOn the plus side, it's easy to get prime seating on both Friday and Saturday night, because it's rarely a full house!  It's also one of the few places left in the area where you can enjoy free, live Belly Dancing during dinner on the weekends, so I give them props for supporting local talent!\n\nRegarding the food, I will say that the lamb dishes are tasty, the complimentary mint tea is exceptionally relaxing and the soups have a genuine down-home taste to them.  However, most of the main entree items are no more than food truck quality pitas and state fair combo plates sold at a premium price.  The quality of the main ingredients just isn't there and a quick trip to the frozen food aisle at Costco would net you most of the supplies needed to start your very own \"Byblos\" franchise at home!\n\nThe desserts are tasty, but few are traditional and none of them, except maybe the baklava, appear to be made by the restaurant.  Also, the bar is limited and the wine selection is nothing short of dreary, though that doesn't stop them from asking fine dining prices on grocery store brands of alcohol.\n\nWhile there's no real \"value\" in the Byblos experience, it's certainly a solid choice when you're just too tired on a Friday evening to drive somewhere else or the inlaws you hate happen to be in town and you absolutely \"must\" take them out!", "date": "2012-03-11 08:28:44"}

It's in his conversation and it's on his plates.\n\nI started with a mushroom soup.  It was velvety and complex in flavor.  I could have sworn there was a heart attack of butter in it, but the chef explained his method which included whipping for texture and a combination of stocks for flavor without making the soup heavy with butters and creams.\n\nMy main was grilled lamb.  Served over a robust white bean and margeze ragout, the lamb was tender with the perfect amount of pink.\nBy this point in the meal I had been entirely sated.  Then came dessert.  Lemongrass cr\u00e8me brulee.   The cr\u00e8me brulee itself was delicate in flavor and consistency, but was paired with a knock-you-down strong lemon sorbet.\n\nThe chef took the time to make rounds in the dining room.  He spoke about cost saving (my entire three courses totaled $21.00), ordering seafood not served elsewhere in Cleveland, and his quest for the perfect cut of lamb.  The chef spoke of this plans for the future - brunch, experiments with house cured meats, and vegetables grown on site.  And as he spoke, I came to understand the smile I had had on my face since my first spoonful of soup.  This man is passionate about what he is doing.

Also surprised to see a lady walk in with a bulldog on leash following her across the tile and she sits down at the table next to us so they should advertise being pet friendly.

I saw used CD's that were not imports or out-of-print that were being sold at $17 and up.

Prices are very reasonable.  An add-on skewer (shrimp, chicken, lamb, beef, salmon) is only $3.75. The kid's menu is fantastic.  They offer gyros and skewers, not just the usual chicken tenders kid's fare.  As someone who has a very restricted diet, I appreciate that I can get skewers separately or a decent kid's plate without a hassle or a weird upcharge.\n\n\nI got the plated gyro from the kid menu and my husband got the regular gyro plate.  He substituted additional salad for rice at the suggestion of staff.  It has to have been one of the freshest salads I've seen in town.  I don't even like tomatoes, but they looked glorious.  My kid plate was larger than I expected.  I don't know that it would be a full meal for most adults, but it would definitely not fall too short.\n\nThe food was fresh, super tasty, and very filling.  The Tzatziki was wonderful. The gyro meat was nicely carved and wasn't overly seasoned.  The pita was not as soft as I would have liked, but not because it was old or stale. I believe it may have been baked just a little too long.\n\nOverall it was a nice experience and very convenient for the SW end of town.

We ordered a large (12 cut) plain cheese pizza ($10.99), an Italian calzone ($10.25 + $1.50 because he added 2 toppings, which are $0.75 a piece), and an order of breadsticks ($6.99).\n\nThe gentleman behind the counter told us it would take 15 minutes.  \n\nWe sat there for 25 minutes (I made sure to look at the clock on my phone).  I personally didn't mind that our order took 10 minutes longer than we were told it would, but for the purposes of reviewing the place-- it was a Tuesday night, there were 2 people working the kitchen and neither one of them seemed to be moving at a very rapid pace, and we only saw 3 other customers the entire time we were there.  So, busy or not, be warned that their concept of when an order will be ready might not be accurate.\n\nThe pizza was good, but nothing that would make me want to order from them again.  He liked his calzone, but he wasn't impressed with it, and was disappointed in the portion size based on the cost.  The breadsticks were a joke.  Seven dollars for 8 SMALL breadsticks that were about as tasty as something I could've baked from a Pillsbury can is outrageous.\n\nI did like that they had a pretty glass container of water with lemon on the counter for customers, though, and it was fun to sit there and watch them prepare our food and toss pizza dough.\n\nI would say try Demore's if it's convenient for you, you don't mind spending a bit more money than you would at any other local pizza joint, and you don't crave any dessert options (no dessert menu whatsoever); but if you have to go out of your way to get there, you'd prefer something more fair in terms of cost, and/or you might crave a cookie or something, go somewhere else.", "date": "2015-11-04 06:11:25"}

Since I've never had a burger from here My impression was they served the best burgers around so I thought well a lot type extra time for a great burger...right?  Nope the patty was thinner than a Micky D's and on top of that is was pink in the middle!  I didn't think it was possible to cook a patty so thin and still have put k in the middle.  Normally I do t eat burgers especially ones from fast food restaurants with pink in them but tonight I was too damn hungry to care!  Not impressed with the service or the burger.  The fries were stellar!! That's how you get a three star effort for that weak sauce performance!", "date": "2018-03-18 04:51:38"}

You just can't beat it. It's directly across from the venue and you don't even have to cross the street and just a minute's walk across the to the center. \n \nThe owners, Lori and Paul (Paul also Old Town Tavern) are remarkable. They're down to earth and such an ease to work with. The pricing was so feasible compared to some of the other nearby restaurants that I had also called to host our events. They helped me with the party planning process and are flexible with providing alternative items other than certain fixed menu items, if you want.\n \nThe food is top notch too. The clients and co-workers raved about the onion rings saying they were the best they've ever had. My favorites are the beer-battered onion rings, baked brie, salmon cakes, rib tips and steak & blue burgers. \n \nPark Place Bar & Grill's cocktail list is well done too. Some great bourbon combinations mixed to perfection. My to-die-for drink of theirs is called \"After Eight\" (Southern Comfort, Peppermint Schnapps, Bailey's Irish Cr\u00e8me, Frangelico. Topped off with chocolate mint gelato). YUMMM. It's pretty much everything a girl could ask for!\n \nThe whole staff is incredibly friendly and was well prepped for our events and the logistics. The owner, Lori, stayed in touch with me all the way up to our event and the day of to discuss options due some unexpected drizzling rain. Ryan was the bartender for our company holiday party event and he was on point the entire evening. They anticipate your needs, offered to help with last minute decoration prep as they were prepping food and settings.

Since I was a cash buyer he had no incentive to even be polite. He straight up lied to me about accepting credit cards, I wanted to use one for the points I get, he said their machines were down. Later throughout the payment portion, when pressed he was essentially forced to take my credit card when I wanted to speak to management. When i indicated that I was considering writing a bad review he told me he did not want to sell me the car. I informed him that the salesman was great, the car was great, it was only him that was unprofessional and in essence a liar. I am only writing this review because his treatment of me was beyond rude. I do t normally write reviews but it came to my attention that this is his personality and demeanor with people. He is only incentivized by the ability to make a commission, since I didnt want an extended warranty and did not need his ridiculous financing, he felt like he had to print out paperwork for nothing.

Since my friend and I didn't want burgers we opted for the salad special of the day - spinach steak salad.  Sounded good and it said there were tons of things in it.  The server asked how we wanted the meat cooked, medium rare and dressing on the side.  The meal came - the beef on the salads was so tough you couldn't eat it and it was cooked until it looked like shoe leather.  The server came by, we complained and she took the dishes back to the kitchen.  then nothing.  The men finished their burgers and we waited and waited and waited.  I finally asked for the manager after watching the server wander around doing nothing.  He came, we explained and he was almost snotty when he said well he'd take care of our bill and go find the missing salads.  He came right back so they must have been just sitting there.  The steak was still overcooked and tough and the salad had one cherry tomato cut in half and a pile of spinach.  It was horrible and neither my friend or I finished ours.  It was so bad that I actually complained to the hotel operations manager.  First, if you are going to advertise a salad as a special, make it special.

This coffee shop was fairly new when we visited and was very quiet. We arrived in the evening, and the place was pretty empty. The decor is amazing and the coffee was very good. Unfortunately I was loving the vibe and couches soo much I forgot to take photos of our drinks. This would be a great place for a date, a meeting, or a group study session. The vibe isn't quiet, but the space is immaculate- the place is huge!!! It's all rustic wood too and it's just gorgeous, there are windows to see outside all around too. Beautiful space and I would visit here if you are looking to hang out and escape the heat or cold! Great little place off the beaten path.", "date": "2018-10-12 15:24:35"}

We ate here last night during AZ. Restaurant week. We did opt for the 5 course and additionally added in the Foie Gras ($15) and the Cheese Plate ($10). We were extremely pleased with our server. We found him to be friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable. The food was excellent and I loved not knowing what might come out next. The one flat and disappointing dish was the Escargot Empinada. The filling was too over whelming for the delicate escargot. All I got was...maybe, lemon zest - not exactly sure. I did enjoy the experience and would return. My only concern was we opted for the 5 course instead of the 4 so that was and additional $10 then from there we also chose the Cheese and Foie Gras as I indicated above. But we still got 5 courses, so in-essence the cheese cost $20 and the Foie cost $35...that is rather excessive and I thought that these would be in addition to the 5th course.... Oh well live and learn. I will still return despite this confusion.", "date": "2013-05-28 20:59:24"}

I was at my wits end with my stubborn 1 year old rescue pitbull, he was about to go back to the pound. He wouldn't listen and I didn't trust him, but after 6 training sessions at new heights I can truly say I have a whole new dog. It has taught him self control, he is calm, finally follows commands and no longer shows signs of aggression.

Table of four. It may have been the worst dining experience of my life. The food came to the table an hour after it was ordered and only after we appealed to the manager. Of course the orders were wrong and ice cold. The check was wrong the first time and all four times that it was redone. I was only going to pay what I thought I owed anyway, but then the manager tore up the check and said the meal was on him. The food? Tasteless pastrami that was 50% fat. The corned beef was higher quality. But in a blind taste test, I would have guessed Irish pub, not \"NY kosher style deli\". This is \"New York Deli?\". God forbid.", "date": "2010-12-31 15:00:11"}

When we got here, there was ample free parking adjacent to the building. At first, we weren't sure we were at the right building because the exterior looked like a bar that was in need of a facelift. Nevertheless, we walked towards the entrance facing the main road, and went inside.\n\nI had brought a lunch that day, but I came away with a taco. Because I HAD to. \n\nHow it works: \nThis place offers a number of different meats: carne asada, barbacoa, pechuga de pollo (chicken breast). You then choose what type of dish you want: tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or tortas. I chose a single carne asada taco and my friend ordered a carne en salsa verde burrito. You can choose to add beans, rice, and/or cheese for an additional charge.  \n\nFrom there, you get your dish without any toppings and head over to the salsa/salad bar to choose whatever you'd like. You then bring it back to the counter and they wrap it for you. We were getting it to go, so they wrapped by taco in some plastic. My friend brought his unwrapped burrito back to the counter so that they could finish putting it together. \n\nService: everybody we interacted with were super friendly. I think the owner was the person who greeted us. They were excellent burrito wrappers too. \n\nFood: Everything tasted very fresh. The salsa/salad bar was clean and nothing looked like it had been sitting for more than a couple hours in the chilled compartments. The meats were really tasty too! \n\nPrice: It's not the cheapest Mexican place, but you get what you pay for in terms of the quality of food.\n\nI'll be back for lunch.", "date": "2017-06-09 21:45:44"}

I have asked my pork \"not too done\" and it comes lightly pink, just the way I like it.  \n\nFinish it off with a very rich and dense Irish Coffee Pot de Cr\u00e8me.
