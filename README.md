# Machine-Learning-COL774
Machine Learning Assignments of the course COL774 taken by Parag Singla, at IIT Delhi.

### About Course: tl:dr;

Assignment portion was way too time consuming, but the weightage was around (33 marks), which is very unbalanced for a rational person. Final exam has more weightage than this.

More than 100 hrs of work vs 2 hrs of major exam. **Fancy that**.

> 3/10 would recommend

### Whether to copy assignments OR not?
Obviously not: Copying assignments will not give you the opportunity to learn, and hence it would defeat the purpose of the course; after saying this, I remember the meaningful quote of Picasso, "Good artists borrow, great artists steal." It's upto you, whether you want to be good or great. The separation line is absurdly wide but a fool never removes his eyes from the sky.


## Assignment-1:
	- Linear Regression
	- Locally Weighted Linear Regression
	- Logistic Regression
	- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
> Correctly done

## Assignment-2:
	- Text Classification Using Naive Bayes
	- MNIST Digit Classification using SVM
> Correctly done

## Assignment-3:
	- Decision Trees and Random Forests
	- Neural Networks

> Demo: When pruning, one should consider the best possible node to prune rather going in leaf to root fashion: I didn't implement it with purpose: It took too much time to train.

## Assignment-4:
	- Competitive Part:
		- SVM and CNN on a given dataset
	- Non-competitive Part:
		- Do any model on given dataset

> Least interesting assignment: Test data was wrong for like a week or something, deadlines were changed way too quickly, it took way too much time to train the model: Ill-managed.

> SVM and CNN are correctly implemented.
